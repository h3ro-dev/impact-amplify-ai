## Leads Integration

- Submissions use Supabase (public.lead_forms) via an Edge Function.
- Required env vars (client):
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Honeypot fields: hidden inputs `hpt` and `hp2` are included in forms.
- Server protections: honeypot drop + light rate limit (3 / 2 min per email).
- Slack notifications: configure `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` in the function secrets.
- Analytics views in Supabase: `leads_daily`, `leads_by_campaign`, `leads_7d`, `leads_today_by_source`.
